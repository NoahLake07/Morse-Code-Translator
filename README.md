# Morse Code Translator
This is an application designed to help translate Morse Code into English, and vice versa. This application's user interface was built using Java Swing and FreshUI.

Upon launching the application, you will see the user interface. There is a main button toolbar at the bottom, with two text areas in the middle. The one on the left is Morse Code entry/output, and the text area on the right is English entry/output.

When a text area is blank, the opposing text area's contents will be translated to the appropriate language. If both are filled, the Morse text area will take precidence for translation.
