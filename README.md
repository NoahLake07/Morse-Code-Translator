# Morse Code Translator
This is an application designed to help translate Morse Code into English, and vice versa. This application's user interface was built using Java Swing and FreshUI.

Upon launching the application, you will see the user interface. There is a main button toolbar at the bottom, with two text areas in the middle. The one on the left is Morse Code entry/output, and the text area on the right is English entry/output.

To translate, select "Translate," located at the toolbar at the bottom of the application.

When a text area is blank, the opposing text area's contents will be translated to the appropriate language. If both are filled, the Morse text area will take precedence for translation. To ensure that no needed data is lost, you may want to erase the side you want to translate to before hitting translate, in order to avoid confusion.

Once a translation is made, both sides of the text may be copied to your clipboard. To do so, click on the "Copy" button below the appropriate text box.
